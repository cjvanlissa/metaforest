#' @title Deprecated functions in package \pkg{metaforest}.
#' @description Metaforest is actively maintained, and I strive to improve its
#' functionality and ease of use. This sometimes means that a function can, or
#' must, be deprecated.
#'
#' The functions listed below are deprecated and will be defunct in
#' the near future. When possible, alternative functions with similar
#' functionality are also mentioned. Help pages for deprecated functions are
#' available at \code{help("-deprecated")}.
