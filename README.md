Background
==========

The goal of MetaForest is to explore heterogeneity in meta-analytic
data, identify important moderators, and explore the functional form of
the relationship between moderators and effect size. To do so,
MetaForest conducts a weighted random forest analysis, using
random-effects or fixed-effects weights, as in classic meta-analysis, or
uniform weights (unweighted random forest). Simulation studies have
demonstrated that this technique has substantial power to detect
relevant moderators, even in datasets as small as 20 cases (based on
cross-validated *R*<sup>2</sup>). Using a variable importance plot,
important moderators can be identified, and using partial prediction
plots, the shape of the marginal relationship between moderators and
effect size can be visualized. MetaForest can be readily integrated in
classical meta-analytic approaches: If MetaForest is conducted as a
primary analysis, classic meta-analysis can be used to quantify
heterogeneity (in fact, MetaForest by default reports a random-effects
meta-analysis on the raw data, and the residuals of the random forests
analysis), or to provide a simplified representation of the linear
effects of important predictors. Conversely, a theory-driven classical
meta-analysis could be complemented by an exploratory MetaForest
analysis, as a final check to ensure that important moderators have not
been overlooked. We hope that this approach will be of use to
researchers, and that the availability of user-friendly R functions will
facilitate its adoption.

Installation
============

You can install `metaforest` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("metaforest")
```

Documentation
=============

Every user-facing function in the package is documented, and the
documentation can be accessed by running `?function_name` in the R
console, e.g., `?graph`, or by checking the [project
website](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/metaforest/reference/index.html)

Example analysis
================

This example demonstrates how one might go about conducting a
meta-analysis using MetaForest. For more information, check the [package
vignette](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/metaforest/articles/Introduction_to_metaforest.html).

``` r
#Load metaforest package
library(metaforest)

#Simulate a meta-analysis dataset with 20 studies, 1 relevant moderator, and 4 irrelevant moderators
set.seed(42)
data <- SimulateSMD()$training

#Conduct an unweighted MetaForest analysis, to estimate the residual tau2
mf.unif <- MetaForest(formula = yi ~ ., data = data,
                      whichweights = "unif", method = "DL", num.trees = 2000)

#Extract the result of this analysis and print them
results <- summary(mf.unif)
